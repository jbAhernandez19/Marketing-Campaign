# Marketing-Campaign
Analysis of email subscription data to determine the best time to send out an email.
- Analyzed data from an email marketing campaign, using R and MySQL, to determine when emails should be sent out
- Created visualizations to illustrate the success rate, open rate, and delivery rate of the emails sent as well as the creation of a time-series graph to plot when emails were sent vs when they were opened
